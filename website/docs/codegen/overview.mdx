# Overview

When running the builders from `flutter_design_codegen`, they look for the `@Design` or `@design` annotations
on your classes. The final output of the builders are:
- `/lib/**/*.design.dart`: generated widget component pagesfor the partial file.
- `/lib/page_factory.design.dart`: this contains the aggregated `generatedComponentPages` that can be directly pass to the designer app.

For each `file_x.dart` that contains an annotated widget, a part file `file_x.design.dart` will be generated. All annotated widget
classes will generate a global component page variable named `generated{Folder1}{Folder2}{...}{Filex}{WidgetName}Page`. 

Finally, a single `page_factory.design.dart` file will be generated by default at the `/lib` folder with a single variable `generatedComponentPages`
containing a list of all generated component pages.

:::note
A component page is the specific type of page that showcases a widget in the designer catalog.

Note that the **folder structure** of the files will be mirrored in the designer explorer as the widget's structure, e.g.

```yaml
libs
  actions
    button.dart
      - ButtonWidget
    button.design.dart
  widgets
    misc.dart
      - WidgetA
      - WidgetB
    misc.design.dart
```

will create the following explorer structure once imported in the designer:

```yaml
Components # you can customize this node's name
  Actions
    ButtonWidget # the parent `button` is omitted
  Widgets
    Misc # this parent stays since there are multiple children widgets
      WidgetA
      WidgetB
```

Note that the `ButtonWidget`'s parent file name is omitted in the explorer structure
since it only contains a single widget `ButtonWidget`.
