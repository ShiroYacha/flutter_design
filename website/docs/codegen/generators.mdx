# Generators

There are currently 2 builders in `flutter_design_codegen`:

- **Design builder**: generates the `*.design.dart` part file that contains the component page fields.
- **Page factory builder**: generates a single `page_factory.design.dart` file that aggregates all generated components into a single importable field.

## Design builder

The design builder scans the dart files for classes annotated with `@Design` or `@design`. Once it finds it, it will generate a component page using the convention: `generated{Folder1}{Folder2}{...}{Filex}{WidgetName}Page`.

The `id` of the component will be the class name in camelCase. The `title` will be by default the widget's name, unless provided by the `@Design` annotation. Both `subtitle`, `description` is omitted if not provided by `@Design`.

### Component section

A component section named after the constructor will be created for the each public constructor of the class. The section contains a `ViewerWidgetBuilder` which contains 
all the meta data required to construct the widget using its constructor. The builder will scan all the fields (optional, named, positional, etc.) and store their metadata into a `fieldMetaDataset` field so 
later the designer would know how to construct thoses fields using [DataBuilders](/docs/designer/data_builder). 

Note that the `fieldMetaDataset` will take into account whether the field is nullable/optional, 
the provided viewer initial values, via `@DesignField(parameter: ...)`.

:::warning

Currently not all types are mapped configured the default data builders (if no data builder is configured for a specific type, the widget designer will throw an error during runtime). To see the currently by default configured data builders, check the [default_data_builders.dart](https://github.com/ShiroYacha/flutter_design/blob/main/packages/flutter_design_viewer/lib/src/default_data_builders.dart) file.

Note that you can always provide your own data builder configuration for a specific type. However some types are not fully supported yet, such as `Function` with parameters. You can find all limitations listed in [FAQ: known limitations](/docs/faq#known-limitations).
:::

Futuremore, the source code of the constructor will be extracted into a source code snippet that will be shown along the widget in the designer. 

:::note
The source is extracted using the [analyzer](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer) via the [abstract syntax tree (AST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) and formatted using [dart_style](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_style) with some auto injected commas. Hence 
the code might be a bit different than what you have actually written, e.g. the comments are gone, the formatting might be different, etc.
:::

A parameter builder class named `_${NAME_OF_CONSTRUCTOR_IN_PASCAL_CASE}ParamBuilder` will also be generated for each constructor. It can be used to configure the examples: if a constructor is annotated with `@DesignExamples`, component example subsection will be generated for each `DesignExample`. The generated sub section has a similar structure to the component section where the user can configure 
the initial values of each field. 


### API docs section

Finally, if the `showApiDocs` is `true` in the annotation (by default it is `true`), a section called `API reference` will be created which shows all the meta data previously collected on the constructor.

## Page factory builder

Similar to the design builder, the page factor builder scans all dart files for classes with the `@Design` or `@design` annotation. It then aggregates it, with an import statement
for each file, the component page fields into a single field: `generatedComponentPages` which can be used to import your component pages to the designer.

:::tip
You can also include pages that are not generated, for instance to create your own component pages manually using the `ViewerDocumentPage` with a `ViewerComponentSection` section from `flutter_design`. To do that, you need to 
specify a valid namespace for the component using the same convention mentioned in [Annotation](/docs/codegen/annotation) and inject it together with the generated component pages when you pass it to the designer

```dart
  DesignSystemViewerApp(
      //...
      pageGroups: [
        buildComponentPageTree(componentPages: 
          [
            ...generatedComponentPages,
            ...yourOwnComponentPages,
          ]),
      ],
    ),
```

Note that by default the pages are sorted by namespace/id names.
