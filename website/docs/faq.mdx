## Known limitations

### Limited supported function types on data builders

Currently, due to limitation in the implementation, only a handful of function signatures are provided out-of-the-box.
Check [Github](https://github.com/ShiroYacha/flutter_design/blob/main/packages/flutter_design/lib/src/types.dart) for the list of supported function type.


## Typical errors

### `type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'xxx'`

This typically happens if a default value or initial value (via `@DesignField(parameter: ...)`) is 
not provided to a non-nullable field type.
