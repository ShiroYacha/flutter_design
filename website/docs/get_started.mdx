# Getting started

Before we dive into the concepts and inner mechanism of the framework. Let's take a quick look at how to quickly setup a minimum design environment and workflow using Flutter design.

## Installation

There are mainly 3 packages you need to install, typically in 2 separate Flutter projects:

- Your production/design package:
  - [flutter_design](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_design): provide basic annotation & framework to integrate with the design ecosystem.
  - [flutter_design_codegen](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_design_codegen): code generator used to generate code to integrate your widgets in the designer.

- Your design viewer app:
  - [flutter_design_viewer](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_design_viewer): designer app used to showcase your design system portfolio and/or to debug your designs under different situations.

  }}
/>

## Basic usage

First, on your design code base you have to add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`: 

```yaml
dependencies:
  #...
  flutter_design:

dev_dependencies:
  #...
  build_runner:
  flutter_design_codegen:
```

Then you would need to annotate the widgets you want to integrate in the design system viewer using the `@design` annotation. Yes, it's that easy :smile: 

:::note
For more details on how to customize the generated page, please check out [Codegen: Annotation](/docs/codegen/annotation).
:::

```dart 
@design // <- Add this single annotation
class SpecialWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  ...
}
```

:::caution
In some cases, this single annotation is not sufficient, e.g. when you have a non-nullable field without a default value. In that case, you would need to 
specify the initial value/parameter of the field using `@DesignField` annotation. For more information, please take a look at [Annotation](/docs/codegen/annotation).
:::

After running the following build runner command,  
``` bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
the following files will be generated:
- `/lib/**/*.design.dart`: generated widget component pagesfor the partial file.
- `/lib/page_factory.design.dart`: this contains the aggregated `generatedComponentPages` that can be directly pass to the `DesignSystemViewerApp` described later.

:::caution
Note that you might need to add this to the readme file (I'm working on a fix to avoid needing this override):

```
dependency_overrides:
  analyzer: 3.2.0
```

If you see errors like: 
```
class ToSourceIgnoringDesignAnnotationsVisitor implements AstVisitor {
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
../../../Dev/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/analyzer-3.3.1/lib/dart/ast/ast.dart:405:6: Context: 'AstVisitor.visitConstructorSelector' is defined here.
```
:::

Finally you can create a flutter designer app (currently supporting Android, iOS, Web, macOS, Windows) to host the design system viewer by adding the following dependencies to the `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  #...
  your_package:
  flutter_design:
  flutter_design_viewer:
```

Then you need to basically setup the design system viewer in your app using the `generatedComponentPages` along with some other things you might want to configure:
- `settings`
  - `enabledLocales`: the locales your design system supports.
  - `enabledThemes`: the `ThemeData` your design system supports.
- `dataBuilders`: your custom data builders
- `pageGroups`: grouped pages in the design system catalog.


:::note
You can also customize the pages by creating static or dynamic contents. For more information, please check out [Designer: Pages](/docs/designer/pages).
:::

```dart

void main() {
  // Recommended to make history browsing work better in web
  setPathUrlStrategy();
  runApp(
    DesignSystemViewerApp(
      settings: ViewerSettings(
        enabledLocales: {
          'en-US': const Locale('en', 'US'),
          'de-DE': const Locale('de', 'DE'),
        },
        enabledThemes: {
          'light': ThemeData.light(),
          'dark': ThemeData.dark(),
        },
        widgetDisplayHeight: 500,
      ),
      pageGroups: [
        // Generated @design/@Design annotated pages
        buildComponentPageTree(componentPages: generatedComponentPages),
      ],
    ),
  );
}

```

That's it! You can then run your designer app on any supported platform :v:
