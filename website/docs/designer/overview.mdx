# Overview

[flutter_design_viewer](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_design_viewer) comes with `DesignSystemViewerApp` widget
that helps you easily create a designer app where you can test your implementation under various scenarios and also
showcase your design system portfolio as following:

```dart

void main() {
  // Recommended to make history browsing work better in web
  setPathUrlStrategy();
  runApp(
    DesignSystemViewerApp(
      settings: ViewerSettings(
        enabledLocales: {
          'en-US': const Locale('en', 'US'),
          'de-DE': const Locale('de', 'DE'),
        },
        enabledThemes: {
          'light': DesignTheme(materialTheme: ThemeData.light()),
          'dark': DesignTheme(materialTheme: ThemeData.dark()),
        },
        widgetDisplayHeight: 500,
      ),
      dataBuilders: {
        String: [
          // Need to use a condition here to use the data builder constructor's default value
          ([d]) =>
              d != null ? MyStringDataBuilder(raw: d) : MyStringDataBuilder(),
        ]
      },
      pageGroups: [
        // Your custom pages
        ...buildGroupedPageTrees(docPages),
        // Theme pages (you can also opt out of the material 3 themes)
        buildThemePageGroup(
          themes: {
            for (final e in themes.entries) e.key: e.value.materialTheme,
          },
          useMaterial3: false,
          iconDataset: List.generate(
            0xea33 - 0xe900,
            (index) => IoniconsData(index + 0xe900),
            growable: false,
          ),
        ),
        // Generated @design/@Design annotated pages
        buildComponentPageTree(componentPages: generatedComponentPages),
      ],
    ),
  );
}

```

There are 2 main properties you can configure on the widget:
- **settings**: pass the static configuration of the designer app. Some of the fields are required such as `enabledLocales`, `enabledThemes` as 
if they are not provided the corresponding features won't function correctly.
- **pageGroups**: pass the collection of structured pages. There are utility methods such as `buildComponentPageTree` that will
convert flat pages (e.g. generated pages) into a structured tree using the `namespace` parameter.

:::note
For more information on how to build different pages, see [Pages](/docs/designer/pages).

## Designer app structure

Here is a quick overview on different key parts of the designer app:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Designer app"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/misc/designer_overview.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/misc/designer_overview_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- **Explorer**: outlines the tree structure of the pages. Allows the user to navigate through the pages. On smaller screens the explorer is by default hidden.
- **Appbar**: contains most global configurations of the designer widget. Settings are persisted in local storage.
  - **Global settings**: situated at the top left corner of the app bar. Allow the user to set the default configuration of the designer.
  - **Search**: allow users to search globally for a page, section, etc. Can also be trigged with keyboard shortcut. 
  - **Links**: misc links if provided.
  - **Theme**: switch between `light`, `dark` and `system` mode.
- **Page**: contains different sections such as widget designer, text paragraphs, custom widgets, etc.
  - **Widget designer**: one of the most useful section that allow users to interact with the widget under different circumstances.
    - **Synchronized frames**: allow users to configure the parent container of the given widget.
    - **Data builder**: provide a set of configurable data builders to generate different data models to pass in the widget's constructor.
    - **Code viewer**: preview the code of the widget.
  - **API docs**: API field definition
  - **User defined content**: text, images, your custom widget section, etc.
