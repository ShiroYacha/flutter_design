# Pages

## Page types

There are 2 types of pages:
- **Group page**: `ViewerGroupPage`, a group page is a page that only contains children pages. It is displayed in the explorer as a collapsable node with only a title.
- **Document page**: `ViewerDocumentPage` a "leaf" page that a title, an optional subtitle/description and contains various sections as described below.

## Group pages

You can pass all pages to the designer using the `pageGroups` field on `DesignSystemViewerApp`. Note that each 'pageGroup' represents a root node on the explorer. 

:::caution
Currently, the namespace on each page node has to be specified additional to the internal tree structure. For generated component pages you can easily use the utility method `buildComponentPageTree` to 
generate the root page group. However, it's less trivial to generate static content via `buildGroupedPageTrees` as you would need to carefully specify the namespace correctly on each page.

An improvement is planned on the roadmap, but please before then, refer to the [example code](https://github.com/ShiroYacha/flutter_design/blob/main/packages/flutter_design_viewer/example/lib/docs.dart) to create static content correctly.

## Sections

Each document page contains a list of sections of following types, displayed in order in a list.

### Paragraph section
`ViewerParagraphSection`, a paragraph section contains a title, an optional description and a collection of items that is displayed in a list:

- **Text**: `ViewerTextCollectionItem`, contains paragraph text title and/or a description.
- **Image**: `ViewerImageCollectionItem`, contains an image and some text and/or description.
- **Widget**: `ViewerWidgetCollectionItem`, contains an arbitary widget provided by the user.

### Component section
`ViewerComponentSection`, a component section contains the widget designer. It uses the specified meta data of the constructor to render the widget and allows 
the user to play with dynamic runtime data using the data builders.

Using the `@Design` annotation, each public constructor (named or factory) will generate a component section. 

:::note
For more information on the specifics of the component section, please refer to [Widget designer](/docs/designer/widget_designer)
:::

### API reference section
`ViewerApiDocsSection`, an API reference section specifies set of parameter meta data for each widget constructor. It takes the meta data
from the component sections in the page.
