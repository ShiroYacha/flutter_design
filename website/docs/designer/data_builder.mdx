# Data builder

The data builder view allows users to configure at runtime the fields passed to the widget's constructor. 

## Mechanism

In order to leverage the data builders, you have to use the `DataBuilderFactory.build(context, 'field_name')` to 
return a dynamic object to your constructor's field. This process is automated when using the [Code generator](/docs/codegen/generators#component-section).

The data builder factory contains a map of `{Type: List of widget data builder}`, each entry uses the field's type as its key and a list of data builder as its value. 
Here is an example of a data builder factory configuration for `String` type. Note that the `[d]` in the builder argument is the initial/default value of the field.


```dart
{
  String: [
    // Need to use a condition here to use the data builder constructor's default value
    ([d]) => d != null
        ? DataTemplateStringRawBuilder(raw: d)
        : DataTemplateStringRawBuilder(),
    ([d]) => DataTemplateStringLoremBuilder(),
  ],
}
```
At runtime, the widget designer provides a list of data builder options based on the target type. 
It also checks the field's default/initial values to seed to the data builder if possible, i.e. the `[d]` argument.

:::tip
The initially selected data builder is the **first** element in the list of data builders of the target type. 
Currently the user provided data builders will be **inserted before** the default data builders.

```dart
DesignSystemViewerApp(
      dataBuilders: {
        String: [
          ([d]) =>
              d != null ? MyStringDataBuilder(raw: d) : MyStringDataBuilder(),
        ]
      },
)
```

Each data builder consists a set of configurable parameters and a user interface to be displayed in the data builder view. You can find some of 
the examples and designs in the following section.
