# Data builder

The data builder view allows users to configure at runtime the fields passed to the widget's constructor. 

## Mechanism

In order to leverage the data builders, you have to use the `DataBuilderFactory.build(context, 'field_name')` to 
return a dynamic object to your constructor's field. This process is automated when using the [Code generator](/docs/codegen/generators#component-section).

The data builder factory contains a map of `{Type: List of widget data builder}`, each entry uses the field's type as its key and a list of data builder as its value. 
Here is an example of a data builder factory configuration for `String` type. Note that the `[d]` in the builder argument is the initial/default value of the field.


```dart
{
  String: [
    // Need to use a condition here to use the data builder constructor's default value
    ([d]) => d != null
        ? DesignStringBuilder(raw: d)
        : DesignStringBuilder(),
    ([d]) => DesignStringLoremBuilder(),
  ],
}
```
At runtime, the widget designer provides a list of data builder options based on the target type. 
It also checks the field's default/initial values to seed to the data builder if possible, i.e. the `[d]` argument.

:::tip
The initially selected data builder is the **first** element in the list of data builders of the target type. 
Currently the user provided data builders will be **inserted before** the default data builders.

```dart
DesignSystemViewerApp(
      dataBuilders: {
        String: [
          ([d]) =>
              d != null ? MyStringDataBuilder(raw: d) : MyStringDataBuilder(),
        ]
      },
)
```
:::

Each data builder consists a set of configurable parameters and a user interface to be displayed in the data builder view. You can find some of 
the examples and designs in the following section.


It is possible to configure the initial data builder using the `@DesignField` annotation. If not specified, the widget designer
will try to match the first fitting data builder using the type of the field as well as the default value.

:::note
For more information on how to configure the data builder properties, please refer to [Annotation](/docs/codegen/annotation). 
All examples on default data builders can be found in the next section.
:::

## Default data builders

The designer comes with a set of commonly used data builders, all prefixed with the keyword `Design-`. 
All examples shown uses the explicit initial value configuration on the class field. 

:::note
For the latest list of out-of-the-box data builders, please check on [Github](https://github.com/ShiroYacha/flutter_design/blob/main/packages/flutter_design_viewer/lib/src/default_data_builders.dart). 
Note that `DesignReadonlyBuilder` and `DesignNullBuilder` are not configured in that list as they are 
configured as fallback in the data builder factory directly.
:::

### Fallback builders

#### 🏭 `DesignReadonlyBuilder` -> `dynamic`

This is the "fallback" data builder when there isn't any other builder configured to handle the field type. It is readonly and will be simply supplying your constructor with a constant value, either
from the default value or from the initial value.

Here is an example using this builder to use complex data types (although to support configuring complex type is on the roadmap).

```dart
class AvatarModel {
  final String uri;
  final double radius;
  const AvatarModel({
    required this.uri,
    this.radius = 30.0,
  });
}

@design
class Avatar extends StatelessWidget {

  @DesignField(
    parameter: AvatarModel(
      uri: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529778873920-4da4926a72c2',
    ),
  )
  final AvatarModel model;

}
```

:::caution
You would need to supply a default/initial value for non-nullable type. Otherwise you might see the following error:
`type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'xxx'`
:::

#### 🏭 `DesignNullBuilder` -> `null`

This is another "fallback" data builder. It will simply provide a `null` value. There is no need to configure to use
this builder, i.e. just leave the nullable field unset (or set as `null`). 

### `String` builders

#### 🏭 `DesignStringBuilder` -> `String`

This is a string builder which allows the user to input the string value in a text field at runtime. It is the default
builder for string field provided with a `String` default/initial value.

```dart
@design
class Avatar extends StatelessWidget {
  @DesignField(parameter: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529778873920-4da4926a72c2')
  final String uri;
}
```

#### 🏭 `DesignStringLoremBuilder` -> `String`

This is a string builder which generates a [Lorem Ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) sentence. You can configure
the initial length of the words, as well as the min/max value of the adjustment range at runtime.

```dart
@design
class Button extends StatelessWidget {
  @DesignField(parameter: DesignParamStringLorem(length: 10, min: 0, max: 100))
  final String label;
}
```

### `double` builders

#### 🏭 `DesignDoubleBuilder` -> `double`

This is a double value builder which allows the user to adjust the double value in a slider/text field at runtime. It is the default
builder for double field provided with a `double` default/initial value.

:::caution
Make sure you enforce a `double` value by specifying the precision or type, e.g. `1.0` instead of `1` (you will
get an error that says `Int` is not a `Double`).
:::

```dart
@design
class Avatar extends StatelessWidget {
  @DesignField(parameter: 30.0)
  final double radius;
}
```

### `int` builders

#### 🏭 `DesignIntBuilder` -> `double`

Similar to `DesignDoubleBuilder`, this is an int value builder with an adjustable slider/text field at runtime. It is the default
builder for int field provided with a `int` default/initial value. 

```dart
@design
class Badge extends StatelessWidget {
  @DesignField(parameter: 2)
  final int count;
}
```

### `bool` builders

#### 🏭 `DesignBoolToggleBuilder` -> `bool`

This is a boolean value builder which allows the user to toggle its state (`true`/`false`) at runtime. It is the default
builder for boolean field provided with a `bool` default/initial value. 

```dart
@design
class Badge extends StatelessWidget {
  @DesignField(parameter: true)
  final bool isHighlighted;
}
```


### `Widget` builders

#### 🏭 `DesignWidgetPlaceholderBuilder` -> `Widget`

This is a widget placeholder builder which allows the user specify the color and size of the placeholder at runtime. It is the default
builder for widget field provided with a `Widget` type. 

:::tip
Note that for this builder, you do not need to explicitly state the default/initial value as a default placeholder will always be created.
However, you could use `DesignParamWidgetPlaceholder` to specify the initial placeholder.
:::

```dart
@design
class SpecialContainer extends StatelessWidget {
  @DesignField(parameter: DesignParamWidgetPlaceholder(color: Colors.red, size: Size(100, 50)))
  final Widget child;
}
```


#### 🏭 `DesignWidgetPlaceholderListBuilder` -> `List<Widget>`

Similar to `DesignWidgetPlaceholderBuilder`, this is a builder that creates a list of placeholders instead of one. You can adjust
the number of placeholders and their size. The color is taken in order from `Colors.primaries`.

:::tip
Note that for this builder, you do not need to explicitly state the default/initial value as a default list placeholder will always be created.
However, you could use `DesignParamWidgetPlaceholderList` to specify the initial placeholder.
:::

```dart
@design
class SpecialContainer extends StatelessWidget {
  @DesignField(parameter: DesignParamWidgetPlaceholderList(count: 4, size: Size(100, 50)))
  final List<Widget> children;
}
```

### `Function` builders

#### 🏭 `DesignStubFunctionBuilder` -> `Function`

This is a function builder that creates a do-nothing stub function. A snack message will be shown nevertheless when the created function is called. 
It is the default builder for function field. There is nothing to configure to use this builder. 

:::caution
Currently, due to limitation in the implementation, only a handful of function signatures are provided out-of-the-box.
Check [Github](https://github.com/ShiroYacha/flutter_design/blob/main/packages/flutter_design/lib/src/types.dart) for the list of supported function type.
:::

:::tip
You can use `DesignStubFunctionBuilder` to enable a button and `DesignNullBuilder` to disable it.
:::

### Special builders

#### 🏭 `DesignPublisherBuilder` -> `Function` + `DesignSubscriberBuilder` -> `dynamic`

This is a special pair of builders implemented using the [Publish/subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern). 
It is typically used to handle a `value`/`onValueChange` situation.

The publisher builds a function that takes a single parameter which would be consumed by the subscriber with the same `key`.

:::caution
Currently, due to limitation in the implementation, only a handful of function signatures are provided out-of-the-box.
Check [Github](https://github.com/ShiroYacha/flutter_design/blob/main/packages/flutter_design/lib/src/types.dart) for the list of supported function type.
:::

```dart
@design
class ToggleButton extends StatelessWidget {
  @DesignField(
    parameter: DesignParamSubscriber(
      key: 'active',
      defaultValue: false,
    ),
  )
  final bool active;

  @DesignField(
    parameter: DesignParamPublisher(
      key: 'active',
    ),
  )
  final void Function(bool?)? onChanged;
}
```
